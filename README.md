# Welcome to HANGMAN

Come play! <https://www.hangmantwosix.com>

I wanted to create a game of hangman that was functionally sound and visually pleasing. 

When starting a new game the application generates a new hidden word. The letters of that word are then guessed by the user. If the image of the hangman is shown before the letter is guessed then the user loses and vise versa. 

The logic for the game is handled in plain **JavaScript**. There are no dependencies required to run the game. Moreover, the application's functionality is a reflection of my love for both Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. It relies on instances of methods, classes, and parameters to execute either a *win* or *loss* state. 

Dynamically rendering the state of the game at any given moment is done by creating and evaluating instances of the word as new data types and objects. Most of the work is done through some variation of a *search algorithm*. The goal is to find items at a given index or key:value pairing and produce an action based on the resulting evaluation. 

The visual component of the application is done through **HTML5** and **CSS3**. Itâ€™s responsiveness to variating viewports, including mobile, is handled by *Flexible Box* layout mode in CSS3. This ensures visual consistency for the typography and design principles used in the application.
